## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey from **Absolute Beginner** to **Advanced Algorithmic Thinker**. 

It follows the **"Sensei Algo" Zero-Friction Method**: a structured, pattern-first approach designed specifically for **Python Developers** and **ML Engineers**. The goal is not just to memorize code, but to visualize data movement and master the underlying logic.

## 🧠 The "Smooth Curve" Philosophy
The code and notes in this repository follow strict principles to ensure deep understanding:

1.  **🚫 No Jargon Dumping:** Every technical term is explained with real-world analogies (e.g., Stacks = Plates) before code.
2.  **👁️ Visual Logic First:** Logic is explained via diagrams, ASCII art, and dry runs before implementation.
3.  **🐍 Pythonic Implementation:** Clean, production-grade code using type hints (`List[int]`, `Optional`) and `snake_case`.
4.  **📈 Scaffolded Difficulty:**
    *   *The Concept* (Why?)
    *   *Naive Solution* (Brute Force)
    *   *Optimized Solution* (The Pattern)
    *   *Complexity Analysis* (Big O)

## 🗺️ The Syllabus & Roadmap

### 🟢 Level 0: The Foundation (1 Week)
*Before writing code, we must understand how to measure efficiency.*
- [ ] **Time & Space Complexity** (Big O, Best/Avg/Worst case, Aux Space)
- [ ] **Basic Mathematics** (Logarithms, AP/GP, Modular Arithmetic)
- [ ] **Bit Manipulation** (XOR, AND, OR, Shifts)

### 🔵 Level 1: Linear Data Structures (2–3 Weeks)
*The bread and butter of programming.*
- [ ] **Arrays & Dynamic Arrays** (Memory layout, Insert/Delete)
    - *Techniques:* Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum/Kadane's.
- [ ] **Strings** (Immutability, Hashing, Pattern Matching/KMP)
- [ ] **Linked Lists**
    - Singly LL (Reverse, Merge)
    - Doubly LL (LRU Cache)
    - Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise & Hare)

### 🟡 Level 2: The Logic Builders (2 Weeks)
*Learning to think recursively.*
- [ ] **Recursion** (Base cases, Stack memory, Tree Recursion)
- [ ] **Backtracking** (N-Queens, Sudoku, Generate Parentheses)
- [ ] **Stacks & Queues**
    - Using `collections.deque`
    - Monotonic Stack (Next Greater Element, Stock Span)

### 🟠 Level 3: Sorting, Searching & Hashing (2 Weeks)
*The most asked topics in interviews.*
- [ ] **Searching** (Binary Search, Rotated Arrays, Answer Space Search)
- [ ] **Sorting** (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort)
- [ ] **Hashing** (Collision handling, `dict()` vs `set()`)

### 🔴 Level 4: Non-Linear Data Structures (3–4 Weeks)
*Where "Mid-Level" separates from "Senior-Level".*
- [ ] **Trees** (BST, Traversals, Views, LCA)
- [ ] **Heaps / Priority Queues** (Min/Max Heap using `heapq`)
- [ ] **Graphs** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Prim/Kruskal, Topological Sort)

### 🟣 Level 5: Advanced Algorithms (3 Weeks)
*Hard interview territory.*
- [ ] **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Memoization vs Tabulation
    - Patterns: 1D, 2D Grid, Knapsack, LCS, Edit Distance
- [ ] **Tries** (Prefix Trees for Autocomplete)
- [ ] **Advanced Structures** (Disjoint Set Union, Segment Trees)
